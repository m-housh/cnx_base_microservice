# uwsgi config, default is to listen on a TCP socket,
# at ``APP_PORT`` environment variable. Which is best when used behind
# an api-gateway, such as ``nginx``.
#
# See example on how to override to use an http port.
uwsgi:
  socket: :$(APP_PORT) 
  module: api.app
  enable-threads: true
  gevent: 4
  master: true
